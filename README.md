## Good practices and code style
This project follows several standards and patterns to ensure clean, maintainable and scalable code, making it easier for anyone to contribute and understand.
### Commits patterns
 1. Use a prefix for every commit. Commomn prefixes include:
   - feat: → for new features
   - fix: → for bug fixes
   - refactor: → for code restructuring without changing functionality
   - docs: → for documentation changes
   - style: → for formatting or code style adjustments
 2. Keep commits focused: Each commit should address only one clear purpose.
     Avoid large, mixed commits — instead, split them into smaller and well-defined ones.
 3. Write meaningful commit messages:
     - **Bad:** fix stuff
     - **Good:** fix: resolve user authentication token validation issue
